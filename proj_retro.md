# Project Retrospective

<h3> WorkFlow </h3>
<hr>
<p> <b><i>What was the process or branching model each person used to pull, develop and push? </i></b>
<br>
Each person worked on their own development branch, called 'zain_dev' or 'madi_dev', then pushed their changes to GitHub to maintain version control. We fetched and merged each other's branches to build on our features. With mostly complete features, that we wanted everyone to have, we merged to the 'rendezvous' branch. For each stage, we created a pull request from 'rendezvous' in to 'master', which Daniel had to approve in order to keep the master branch clean. Stable code and features live in the master branch.
<br><br>
<b><i>What development tools/frameworks did your project use?</i></b>
<br>
ReactJS, Gradle, grails, groovy, HTML, CSS, recharts, bulma 
<br><br>

<b><i>How effectively did your team manage task distribution among team members?</i></b>
<br>
Our team effectively managed task distribution among members as tasks were assigned weekly to members so they knew what they were to accomplish by the next meeting. If the task a team member was given a task they could not complete, another team member could help out at the next meeting, provide assistance over Slack or the task would be re-assigned to another member with the original member being given a new task.
