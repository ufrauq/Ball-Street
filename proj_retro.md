# Project Retrospective

<h3> WorkFlow 
<hr>
</h3>
<p> <b><i>What was the process or branching model each person used to pull, develop and push? </i></b>
<br>
Each person worked on their own development branch, called 'zain_dev' or 'madi_dev', then pushed their changes to GitHub to maintain version control. We fetched and merged each other's branches to build on our features. With mostly complete features, that we wanted everyone to have, we merged to the 'rendezvous' branch. For each stage, we created a pull request from 'rendezvous' in to 'master', which Daniel had to approve in order to keep the master branch clean. Stable code and features live in the master branch.
<br><br>
<b><i>What development tools/frameworks did your project use?</i></b>
<br>
For our development tools/frameworks, we used a combination od ReactJS, Gradle, Grails and Groovy. To power our front-end, we implement HTML/GSP and CSS in addition to ReCharts for our graphs with bulma being used for our login screen. 
<br><br>

<b><i>How effectively did your team manage task distribution among team members?</i></b>
<br>
Our team effectively managed task distribution among members as tasks were assigned weekly to members so they knew what they were to accomplish by the next meeting. If the task a team member was given a task they could not complete, another team member could help out at the next meeting, provide assistance over Slack or the task would be re-assigned to another member with the original member being given a new task.

<h3> MVC / Design Patterns </h3>
<hr>
<p>  MVC / Design Patterns information here. </p>

<b><i>What is the relationship between user interfaces, application logic, and data in your project?</i></b>
<br>

<b><i>Did you implement your server-side program as a REST API?</i></b>
<br>

Our front end communicates directly with our back-end through the use of  .gsp (html) files calling JavaScript files made up of the REACT components. These REACT components then call the controller classes which fetch the data directly from the back-end. 


<b><i>Which collection of classes serve as the M, V, and C in MVC?</i></b>
<br>
M(odel):
V(iew):
C(ontroller):
<br><br>


<b><i>How do these classes communicate with each other? Give an example based on a user action.</i></b>
<br>
For our project, BallStreet, we had a limited number of classes as the majority of our back-end was powered by our SQL database. Our classes communicate via API calls? 
<br>

<b><i>If you were to start the project again today, what aspects of code organization could be improved in your project?</i></b>
<br>
Actually need to write something here.
