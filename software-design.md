# Software Design

<br>

To get BallStreet up and running, a lot of planning was put into all the classes, interfaces, inheritance, data structures and databases.

This UML diagram  was generated in IntelliJ showing all of the domain classes existing in our Grails project. The UML is extremely simplified in comparison to our previous stage diagrams. This is due to a change of design where it was chosen to store all of the player and game data on an online SQL Server.

The BallStreet UML was generated using www.draw.io, a tool that allows for easy creation and editing of UML diagrams. In addition, draw.io also allows collaborative editing through Google Drive, which is important in team projects such as this one.
