# UI Design




BallStreet's user interface is going to be simplistic and minimalistic to provide an easy to navigate platform and focus on the applications functionality. The colour scheme will be a combination of red and grey with a few additional accent colours such as blue and yellow. The user dashboard has words in addition to small icons to help ease the navigation through the application. <br><br>
The dashboard includes the following pages: 
<ul> 
<li> Profile Information</li>
<li> User Player Stocks Owned</li>
<li> Graphs of Player Stocks Performance</li>
<li> BasketStreet Stock Market </li> 
<li> Request for Trades from other Players</li>
</ul>
<br><br>


Here are some examples of BallStreets UI: <br>


<h2 id="loginScreen"> Login Screen </h2>
<img src= "/CS2212-Team5/assets/images/BallStreetLogin2.jpg" width = "600px" ><br><br>
The image above will be used as the login screen for BallStreet. From this screen, the user can select "Sign Up" to create a new user profile. Once this button is clicked, they will be sent to a new screen to create a profile. If the user already has an account set up, the user can login in easily by typing in their username and password and selecting "Login In". The login in process will be powered by the Twitter login authorization API. Once logged in properly, the user will be able to access their account <a href="#userDashboard">dashboard </a>and start making trades. <br><br> 
<h2 id="userDashboard"> User Dashboard </h2>
<img src= "/CS2212-Team5/assets/images/BallStreetDashBoard1.jpg" width = "600px" ><br><br>
The user dashboard will be the main screen for the BallStreet application. From this screen, the user will be able to access the player stock market, their stocks, their current balance and past transactions, profile settings and their current stock trade requests from other users.
