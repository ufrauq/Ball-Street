# Project Plan
For our web application, we will be combining a passion for sports with a love of business. BallStreet, or as we like to call it our "brain-child", incoporates basketball and stocks to produce the ultimate fantasy trading experience for users. 
<br><br>
By producing a unique algorithm based on player performance, our application generates stock prices of all basketball players. These prices fluxuate throughout the day to give the user the thrill of playing the stock trading game. 
<br><br>

Some features of BallStreet include: 
<ul>
<li> User Profile with Dashboard </li>
<li> Buying and Selling of Player Stocks</li>
<li> Direct User to User Stock Trades</li>
<li> Ablility to Enqueue Future Trades</li>
</ul>

For the authorization of logging in, BallStreet will be using the Twitter User Identification API (link to twitter's api page? ). Additionally, BallStreet will use data collected from the MySportsFeeds.com via their API to determine stock prices of players based on game stats, injuries and team wins.
