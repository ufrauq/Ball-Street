<h1> 
   Welcome to BallStreet | By Team 5 in CS 2212
</h1>
The CS 2212 course is an interactive, skill building course which focuses 
on development of projects in a team setting. This allows for students to 
gain experience working on a programming project with multiple people and 
learn how to properly manage a project in addition to a team. This course 
layes the fundamentals of properly designing projects to allow for easy 
changes to be implemented in the future while focusing on inheritance and 
proper communication between classes in addition to the front and back ends 
of the program. <br><br>

For our web application, we will be combining a passion for sports with a 
love of business. BallStreet, or as we like to call it our “brain-child”, 
incorporates basketball and stocks to produce the ultimate fantasy trading
experience for users. By producing a unique algorithm based on player performance,
our application generates stock prices of all basketball players. These 
prices fluctuate throughout the day to give the user the thrill of playing 
the stock trading game. <br><br>

BallStreet will being using a combination of Java, JavaScript, and Groovy, 
all managed on the framework Grails. We will be using IntelliJ for our IDE.
We will be using API’s from Twitter for user authorization and we are using 
the API from MySportsFeeds.com to get our data to calculate the stock trading 
algorithm. <br><br>

   Stage Updates

<h3> Stage 1 </h3>
For Stage 1 of our project, we created our project website, UI mockups, UML diagrams, developed user stories and set up 
GitHub issues. For our website, we created a Home Page, a Team Roster Page, Software Design Page, UI Design Page and 
Project Plan Page. Our homepage consists of information about the CS2212 course and our web application. The Team Roaster page 
consists of all our team members, their photos, their skills and their roles in the project. The Software Design page discusses
the outline of our project and includes our UML diagrams. The UI Design page consists of a variety of mockups for our 
application and what features each page includes. Lastly, our Project Plan page discusses all the features we hope to implement 
and the timeline for each feature.<br>
As for our user stories, we created a number of stories such as logging in, making trades and the creation of leagues. We will
start working towards the completion of these stories in stages 2 and 3. 
<br><br><hr>
<h3> Stage 2 </h3>

For the second stage of our project, we developed the majority of the front end of our application. This includes the 
login page, the leagues page, and the logout button on the settings page. For the login page, we were initially were going to
use the Twitter login API but after further research and working to intergate the API into our project,
we discovered the Twitter API uses a public callback and our project must run on local machines. Hence, we will be implementing
location verification, authorization and identication locally in Stage 3. Currently, a user can create an a account and then
login. From there, they can check out their leagues or join a league, in addition to being able to logout from the setting page.<br><br>
As for our leagues page, we have allowed for users to create leagues, join leagues and leave leagues. During the creation of
the league, the user names the league and can choose to add a password to the league. There is a maxium of 25 users
that can be added to each league. <br><br>
Throughout the site, we have installed a top bar crawler that displays information to the user. Currently, it displays
a few different messages but we hope to be able to display basketball game scores in the bar in the third stage of our
project. The front-end uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React components to add functionality and allow for a
simple and easy to interact with user interface.<br><br>

As for the back end of our application, we have implemented 2 controller classes and 3 model classes. These elements were
created through Grails using Groovy, React and JavaScript.
<br><br><hr>

<h3> Stage 3 </h3>
For stage three of our project, we implemented the remaining features completing our user stories in addition to
adding functionality to our application. The features we implemented consisted of a stock market page, a user stocks page,
a players page, a transaction page and a user porfile page in which is viewed when the user first logs in. <br><br>

To add fucntionallity to our project, we created an SQL database hosted with Microsft Azure to hold all player data, stock
price information and past game information. Our database collects and stores all the information by calling the MySportsFeeds
API. We have implemented a local authentification in which user information is stored
(login and usernames) in addition to storing the user's networth and cash balances. To best display this information, we have
used the graphing JavaScript functions, and displayed the graphs on the user profile page. This is also the case on the player 
pages as their stock prices are tracked. <br><br>

<h3>Front End Features</h3>
<ul> 
   <li> <h4>Stock Market Page </h4></li>
   
   <p> This page is where users can purchase stocks from various players. The Top 5 players with the most points are listed
   at the top to notify users of the best players on the market. We have implemented a Search Bar on this page that allows
   users to search for a desired player. The user can also browse all players alphabetically by scrolling down and switching 
   between the next and previous pages.</p>
   
   <li> <h4>User Stock Page </h4></li>
   
   <p> The user stocks page displays all the player stocks they own and the shows the price at which they were
   purchased and how many were bought. Additionally, users can sell their stocks on this page. </p>
   <li> <h4> Players Page </h4></li>
   <p> As for the players page, we have implemented a Search/Drop down bar in which the user selects/searchs for their 
   desired player. Once the player has been selected, the player's infomation and past 10 day networth is displayed. </p>
   <li> <h4>Transactions Page </h4></li>
   <p> On the transactions page, users can view past histories of all the stocks they have purchased and sold. This page
   also includes a "Pending Transactions" section which are transactions that are to be processed. The transactions are
   processed every 2 minutes. </p>
   <li> <h4> User Profile Page </h4></li>
   <p> The user profile page now contains a temporary profile image, the user's current balance and networth in addition
      to two graphs displaying the user's balance and networth changes for the past 20 minutes.
