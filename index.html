<h1> 
   Welcome to BallStreet | By Team 5 in CS 2212
</h1>
The CS 2212 course is an interactive, skill building course which focuses 
on development of projects in a team setting. This allows for students to 
gain experience working on a programming project with multiple people and 
learn how to properly manage a project in addition to a team. This course 
layes the fundamentals of properly designing projects to allow for easy 
changes to be implemented in the future while focusing on inheritance and 
proper communication between classes in addition to the front and back ends 
of the program. <br><br>

For our web application, we will be combining a passion for sports with a 
love of business. BallStreet, or as we like to call it our “brain-child”, 
incorporates basketball and stocks to produce the ultimate fantasy trading
experience for users. By producing a unique algorithm based on player performance,
our application generates stock prices of all basketball players. These 
prices fluctuate throughout the day to give the user the thrill of playing 
the stock trading game. <br><br>

BallStreet will being using a combination of Java, JavaScript, and Groovy, 
all managed on the framework Grails. We will be using IntelliJ for our IDE.
We will be using API’s from Twitter for user authorization and we are using 
the API from MySportsFeeds.com to get our data to calculate the stock trading 
algorithm. <br><br>
