<h1> 
   Welcome to BallStreet | By Team 5 in CS 2212
</h1>
The CS 2212 course is an interactive, skill building course which focuses 
on development of projects in a team setting. This allows for students to 
gain experience working on a programming project with multiple people and 
learn how to properly manage a project in addition to a team. This course 
layes the fundamentals of properly designing projects to allow for easy 
changes to be implemented in the future while focusing on inheritance and 
proper communication between classes in addition to the front and back ends 
of the program. <br><br>

For our web application, we will be combining a passion for sports with a 
love of business. BallStreet, or as we like to call it our “brain-child”, 
incorporates basketball and stocks to produce the ultimate fantasy trading
experience for users. By producing a unique algorithm based on player performance,
our application generates stock prices of all basketball players. These 
prices fluctuate throughout the day to give the user the thrill of playing 
the stock trading game. <br><br>

BallStreet will being using a combination of Java, JavaScript, and Groovy, 
all managed on the framework Grails. We will be using IntelliJ for our IDE.
We will be using API’s from Twitter for user authorization and we are using 
the API from MySportsFeeds.com to get our data to calculate the stock trading 
algorithm. <br><br>

<h3> Stage 1 </h3>
For Stage 1 of our project, we created our project website, UI mockups, UML diagrams, developed user stories and set up 
GitHub issues. For our website, we created a Home Page, a Team Roster Page, Software Design Page, UI Design Page and 
Project Plan Page. Our homepage consists of information about the CS2212 course and our web application. The Team Roaster page 
consists of all our team members, their photos, their skills and their roles in the project. The Software Design page discusses
the outline of our project and includes our UML diagrams. The UI Design page consists of a variety of mockups for our 
application and what features each page includes. Lastly, our Project Plan page discusses all the features we hope to implement 
and the timeline for each feature.<br>
As for our user stories, we created a number of stories such as logging in, making trades and the creation of leagues. We will
start working towards the completion of these stories in stages 2 and 3.

<h3> Stage 2 </h3>

For the second stage of our project, we began developing the front end of the application. This includes the login page, the
leagues page, and the logout button on the settings page. Throughout the site, we have installed a crawler that tells the
user information. The front-end uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.<br><br>

As for the back end of our application, we have implemented 2 controller classes and 3 model classes. We implemented Grails using Groovy, React and JavaScript.
