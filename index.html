<h1 >Welcome to BallStreet | By Team 5 for CS 2212 </h1> 

For our web application, we will be combining a passion for sports with a love of business. 
BallStreet, or as we like to call it our "brain-child", incoporates basketball and stocks to
produce the ultimate fantasy trading experience for users. 
<br><br>
By producing a unique algorithm based on player performance, our application generates stock 
prices of all basketball players. These prices fluxuate throughout the day to give the user 
the thrill of playing the stock trading game.
