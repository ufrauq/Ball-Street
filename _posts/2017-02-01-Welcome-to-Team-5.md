For our web application, we will be combining a passion for sports with a love of business. BallStreet, or as we like to call it our “brain-child”, incorporates basketball and stocks to produce the ultimate fantasy trading experience for users. By producing a unique algorithm based on player performance, our application generates stock prices of all basketball players. These prices fluctuate throughout the day to give the user the thrill of playing the stock trading game.

BallStreet will being using a combination of Java, JavaScript and Groovy, all managed on the framework Grails.

*(i dont actually know what we are using at the is point. we need to decide on this. we also need to write a description of each langauge and framework i think after reviewing the marking rubric on the course site)*
