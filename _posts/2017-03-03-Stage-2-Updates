For the second stage of our project, we developed the front end of the application. This includes the login page, the
leagues page, and the logout button on the settings page. Throughout the site, we have installed a crawler that tells the
user information. <br><br>

As for the back end of our application, we have implemented 2 controller classes and 3 model classes.
